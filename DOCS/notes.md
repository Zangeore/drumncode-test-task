1. ***Search***

When performing a fulltext search using fields like title or description, the system returns matching tasks as if they are top-level items â€” even if they are actually nested.

To provide full context, it automatically includes all parent tasks up to the root. As a result, the output is a full tree structure that may start from a deeply nested task rather than a true top-level one, but still reflects the entire hierarchy above and below each match.

This allows users to see both the relevant tasks and where exactly they belong in the overall task structure.
